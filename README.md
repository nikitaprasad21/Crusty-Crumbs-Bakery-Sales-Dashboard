The primary objective of Crusty Crumbs Bakery is to optimize sales for the year 2020 by identifying the customer categories that yield the highest and lowest profitability. Moreover, the bakery aims to determine the top salesperson and conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data across different regions, facilitating strategic initiatives to enhance sales effectiveness.

### Tools Used

### Work Process

By utilizing Excel, I conducted comprehensive dataset cleaning for Sales Analysis of Crusty Crumbs Bakery. 

Subsequently, I leveraged Tableau for data visualization, and predicted significant observations and actionable recommendations.

Utilizing Tableau, I created a Retail Bakery Store - Sales Report Dashboard. I facilitate the anticipation of customer positive response, identification of influential factors, and generation of actionable insights - empowering the bakery to optimize operations and elevate customers satisfaction levels.

* In contrast, snacks are currently experiencing lower sales, signaling an opportunity for targeted marketing and product enhancements.

3. Salesperson performance showcases distinct trends:

* Marc Williams emerges as the top-performing salesperson for the year 2020, exhibiting exceptional sales performance across all categories.

4. Seasonal fluctuations impact sales trends:

* June emerges as the highest selling month, reflecting strong consumer demand and effective marketing strategies.
* However, sales experience a significant decline of 43% in July, indicating a need to investigate potential factors contributing to this decline and implement corrective measures.
